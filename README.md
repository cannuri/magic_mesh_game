# Magic Mesh Game

A collaborative experiment where individual 30-minute game jam entries get **meshed together by an AI agent** into one interconnected game world.

## Origin: Open Claw Game Jam

This project started at an Open Claw Game Jam - a 30-minute game jam where participants build a game of a wizard.
